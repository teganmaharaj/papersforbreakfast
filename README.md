## Papers for Breakfast

This is the repo which hosts "Papers for breakfast", an informational blog thing I do when I read papers (often while eating breakfast). 

Here is the website: [papersforbreakfast.info](http://www.papersforbreakfast.info)

### About the website
It's currently _very_ basic, and I set it up in an afternoon after I mostly just followed this git documentation:
https://pages.github.com/ (including how to redirect from a custom domain), and this very helpful tutorial: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/.
