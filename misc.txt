Quick-ish way to transfer figs from one paper to another with overleaf (possibly sharelatex):
Click the picture so that you're viewing it, 
Right-click it and choose 'open image in a new tab'
Copy that new tab's url
Go to your other project and in the dropdown beside 'files' choose 'url' and paste the url
